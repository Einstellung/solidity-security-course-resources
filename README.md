# Solidity audits and secure development material
This repo contains most of the practical examples and exercises that I use during my lectures about Solidity security and auditing. These resources are designed for students with a beginner (but practical!) knowledge of the Solidity language and Smart Contract development that are looking to take the next step and learn about security.

- [BasicExamples](/BasicExamples) contains easy contracts that illustrate individual security issues
- [Exercises](/Exercises) contain contracts that, although most of the code being redacted, simulate the structure of a real SC with a couple of vulnerabilities per contract
- [Faillapop CTF](/Faillapop) contains a whole protocol with multiple contracts that interact with each other to simulate a real world audit. Still, all the vulnerabilities follow very basic patterns. 


Some of the snippets may be heavily based on open source resources. If you feel you should get credit for those, ping me and I will add your name and Github here!

Feel free to use this material adding a link to my repo :)
