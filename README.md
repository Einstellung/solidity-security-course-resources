# Solidity Security and Auditing Examples

Welcome to the Solidity Security and Auditing Examples repository! This collection contains a variety of practical examples and exercises that I use during my lectures on Solidity security and auditing. These resources are tailored for students who possess a 🌱 beginner 🌱 level of practical knowledge in the Solidity language and smart contract development. If you're ready to take the next step and delve into the realm of security, you're in the right place.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following sections:

### 🐛 Basic Examples 🐛

This section contains extremely simplified contracts, almost like code snippets, that highlight individual security issues. It's an excellent starting point for your journey. Read about each of the issues, and then dive into the code to identify the bugs. You can even challenge yourself by crafting your own Proof of Concept (PoC) solutions.

### 🐣 Exercises 🐣

In the "Exercises" section, you'll find slightly more advanced contracts that include some structure. While the majority of the code is redacted, these exercises simulate the appearance of real smart contracts. They're designed to give you a taste of what real-world contracts might look like and set you on your bug-hunting path.

### 💪 Faillapop Mock-Audit Environment 💪

Here, you'll discover a complete protocol comprising multiple contracts that interact with one another. Unlike a traditional Capture The Flag (CTF) approach, this environment mirrors a fully functional real-world protocol that is seeking *your* audit. While many vulnerabilities follow basic patterns, this environment offers you the chance to mimic the audit of a larger codebase, compared to the exercises in the previous section.

Some of the code snippets may draw heavily from open-source resources. If you believe you deserve credit for any of these snippets, my sincere apologies. Please reach out to me so I can properly acknowledge you by adding your name and GitHub details to the relevant section.
