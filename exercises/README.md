# Basic bug huntig exercise!

After you have learnt to recognize basic security issue you can practice your skills with this basic exercises. Each contract follows the simplified structure of a real-looking contract (although not fully functional), such as those in the [Faillapop](../faillapop) "CTF", so you will find a lot of redacted functions that are there just to give you context. 

Each of those contracts will have 2-3 security issues for you to find and exploit! I recommend using this to practice PoC crafting using foundry.
